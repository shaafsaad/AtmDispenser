# AtmDispenser
Have used Spring Boot as the framework and REST Api with PUT method to withdraw amount.
URL for postman is 'http://localhost:8080/user/withdraw/{withdrawAmount}'
Example: http://localhost:8080/user/withdraw/500
Unit testing has been done using Junit and mocking using mockito.
Have added few dummy classes for show purpose whose coverage has not been done.
